# CERTIFICATE-IN-MINIMAL-ACCESS-SURGERY---ONLINE-COURSE
Teaching surgery outside of the traditional operating theater was once considered impossible. However, thanks to advancements in digital technology, such as screen sharing, live sessions, and real-time Q&A chats, online courses have become a reality.
For beginners in laparoscopic surgery, grasping fundamental concepts like instrument design, access techniques, port placements, fear of causing injury by blind insertion of trocars and the nuances of 2D/3D laparoscopy can be challenging. Understanding aspects like reading digital displays on insufflators, monitoring ETCO2, and comprehending the effects of pneumoperitoneum on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems is crucial for safe laparoscopic procedures. Mastery of electro-surgery and the technicalities of achieving high-definition displays on monitors are essential components of learning laparoscopy surgery.
In our online classroom-style lectures, we don’t just share slides; we provide a comprehensive understanding of the science and art of laparoscopy surgery, covering all the necessary topics for acquiring these skills in a concise and time-bound manner.
